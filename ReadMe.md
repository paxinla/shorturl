----------

My personal url shortener. Powered by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Github Pages API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/repos#pages) .

Correspondence between shortened urls and origin urls are stored in [another repository](https://github.com/paxinla/gh-pages-url-shortener-db) . 

This idea comes from [This repository](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener) .
